    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An omelette (also spelled omelet) is a dish made from eggs,
        fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is a common practice for an omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, 
        vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), cheese, onions or some combination of the above. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs into the pan, 
            tilt the pan ever so slightly from one side to another to allow the eggs to swirl and cover the surface of the pan completely.</li>
        <li>Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg. Repeat once or twice more until the egg has just set.</li>
        <li>At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like â€“ some grated cheese, sliced ham.</li>
    </ol>
